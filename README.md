# JenkinsWorkshop
A great workshop :D!

In this workshop's repo we learned how to build images and deploy Docker containers.

For this we checked how to create DockerFiles and how they work. 

Now, we are implementing a pipeline in Jenkins that will test the stages of preparation, construction, image analysis, docker pushes to the registry & deployment.

Hope I succeded in this implementation :3
